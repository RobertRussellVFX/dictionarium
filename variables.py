nominative = '''First Form→Nominative→This is the naming case. It is for subjects. Its name comes from the Latin word “nomen” or name. It is the who or what does the action of the verb.

Examples: Mary eats cake.

The cake is so good.

The object of a linking verb like the verb “to be” is also in the nominative case.'''


genitive = '''Second Form→Genitive→This is the possessive case. Isn’t it cool that this case puts the word in its proper declension? It shows the possession of the noun. So, it’s likely not surprising that the word “gens” means tribe or nation. You can find this word easily in the sentence because it has an ‘s in it or follows the word “of”. Fun fact. There is no Latin word for the preposition “of”. When you see an “of” you know it is genitive.

Examples: Caesar’s salad salad of Caesar God’s love

love of God (called an objective genitive because God is the object of the love)

part of me (called a partitive because its part of the whole me)'''


accusative = '''Accusative→This case, which is like it sounds, “accusatory” , is the case of the direct object. This is that which receives the action of the verb. It is also used for prepositions which often follow verbs of motion. Also, interestingly, neuter words have the same nominative and accusative form. Makes sense, right? Things don’t give and receive the same way a person can.

Examples: Mark hit the ball. Charlotte ran to the store. The ship sailed across the ocean'''

dative = '''Dative→The dative case is used for the indirect object, or the person who benefits from an action, or the purpose for which something is done. The word dative comes from the Latin word “datum” which is the participial form of to give. Often it is expressed in English with the word “for” and sometimes with the word “to”. A very basic way to think about it is as that to whom (or which) the whole sentence is referred.'''

ablative = '''Ablative→This case, is the case for objects of prepositions such as “by, with, from, in”. They are “wide from” the rest of the sentence. The word “ab” means “by, from” and the word “latus” means “far, wide”. The word properly is the participial form of “aufero”. Among the meanings: remove, withdraw carry, bear, obtain.

Up until now, the use of the ablative has been very simple. If you have a preposition that takes the ablative, like “ab”, use the ablative. Now we need to make further distinctions about the use of the ablative case. The ablative case is used for a “taking away”, for a “togetherness” and for a quality of “location”. We will now not always use prepositions and we will have to do a bit of experimenting with our Latin sentences. Why? Sometimes the ablative will have a preposition before it, sometimes now it will not though.

The most significant English prepositions whose objects are rendered by the ablative in Latin are “by”, “with”, “in” and “from”. These are significant because they express the broad uses of the ablative. When you translate these into Latin, sometimes you will use a preposition and sometimes you will not.'''

dativeType = '''A.Indirect Object

He gave Mary a book. Mary is dative. Mary receives the action of giving

in a conscious way.

B. Advantage (or disadvantage)

He bought a gift for Mary. Mary is dative. Mary receives the advantage of the gift.

C. Dative of Purpose

I ate the bread for strength. Strength is dative. It’s the purpose for eating

bread.

D. Dative of Reference. This dative indicates the person or thing interested in the action. Here is an example: For me, this sentence is the best way to remember it. The dative of reference is the phrase “for me”. In a sentence the whole sentence has been referred to me. Datives of reference are common. You can translate them apart from the whole sentence and use phrases

that work to convey the idea of reference. Here are some examples. The underlined words would be datives of reference.

For me, happiness is chocolate cake.

As far as I am concerned, happiness is chocolate cake.

In my eyes, happiness is chocolate cake.

In all of the above cases, you would translate the underlined phrase as “mihi” in Latin

E. Dative of Possession. This dative indicates the person who owns. It is commonly used with the verb ‘to be’, in this way:

Sunt mihi canes Literally: There are dogs for me.

Expressing the idea of possession better: I have dogs.

For the first time, in Latin, you are allowed, with these two new cases, a certain freedom in translation.

dativeSummary = ''''''

vocative = """The vocative is the case of direct address. For example, if you wish to tell “Mary” to do something, you would address her.

Mary, wash the dishes.

The vocative case is usually the same as the nominative. The exceptions are in the second declension singular.

Nominatives that end in “us” or “ius” : “serve” not “servus” and “fili” not “filius”

Because you cannot be familiar with God, you are expected to use the formal nominative form: Deus, not the vocative form that ends in “e”."""

imperative = """So far, you can only compose sentences that are make statements. That is why all your translations to date have been in the indicative mood. The indicative is the mood for statements. Today we will learn the imperative mood. The imperative is the mood of command. It is commonly found only in the present tense and the second person.

**The singular is formed by simply taking the present stem**

*laudo, laudare,… à lauda Meaning: (you sing.) Praise*

*moneo, monere,… à monē Meaning: (you sing.) Warn*

*rego, regere,… à rege Meaning: (you sing.) Rule*

*audio, audire,… à audi Meaning: (you sing) Hear*

**The plural is formed by adding “-te”**

*lauda + te = laudate Meaning: (you pl) Praise*

*monē + te = monēte Meaning: (you pl) Warn*

*rege + te = regite2 Meaning: (you pl) Rule*

*audi + te = audite Meaning: (you pl) Hear*"""
